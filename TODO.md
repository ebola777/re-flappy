# Todo

Write the Q learning algorithm in `src/Q.js`.

Change game speed at line 52 of `src/screens/MainScreen.js`. (`for (var i = 0; i < XXX; i++)`). 
It means ticking XXX times then rendering once. The ticking (calculating) time is short while the rendering frequency is limited by browser. Rendering is just drawing and doesn't affect any data. 

Change the space between up and down pipes at line 174, 178 of `src/screens/MainScreen.js`. 

* (1) The last number at line 174
* (2) The two numbers at line 178
* (3) (1) = 2 * (2)
